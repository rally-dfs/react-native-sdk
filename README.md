## RallyMobile SDK

RallyMobile SDK, a key component of RallyProtocol, enables developers to equip users with embedded wallets in their mobile apps—no signups, third-party logins, or popups required. Embedded wallets are created instantly, encrypted by the device’s secure enclave, and are permissionless and free.

Most importantly, RallyMobile eliminates intermediaries, allowing developers to retain full ownership of user and wallet data.

## RallyTransact
RallyTransact enables gasless transactions for on-chain operations, allowing users to perform one-tap token transfers, NFT claims, and even smart contract deployments from within mobile apps, all without gas fees.
